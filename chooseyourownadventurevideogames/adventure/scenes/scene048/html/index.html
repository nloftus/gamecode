       <p>You follow the lady while one of the men taking the piece of paper you found. You pass by different labatories with doors being<br>
         locked and saying the codename of the projects. You approch a door, on the door it said "PROJECT:BEACON". The lady opens the door and you see<br>
        a huge circular table in the middle of the white room with a floating liquid jello like object on top of the table.</p>
