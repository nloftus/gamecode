    <p>You open the window, start going up the stairs and hear the steel door<br>
       open and hear a choir of people marching in with a lady yelling "Open fire!!".<br>
        You hear bullets fly twards you as you fly up the stairs trying not to get shot by the soilders.<br>
      As you ascend to the roof you see a helicopter with someone next to the open door screaming "GET ON!!!".<br>
      You get on the helicopter as it flies away with gunshots flying in every direction as the helicopter flies away.</p>
