      <p>You see keys attached to her belt around her waist. You sprint towards the door grabbing her keys as you run away from her. You hear gunshots in the distance as shes firing at you
      <br> and you hear her talk to some one with the stranger saying "We have a prisoner 10t54 escaping on isle 10005.
      <br> Bring as many men as you can and have them open fire on prisoner 10t54.". After talking into her walkie talkie she fires more shots at you and one hits at you leg.
      <br> You scream in agony as you limp and aproach a hallway that splits into 4 directions with army men at all ends. As you stop you see vents alongside all of the hallways.</p>

          <p>What do you do now?</p>
