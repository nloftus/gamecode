        <p>A man wakes up in a dense foggy forest naked with only a pack of 20 matches and a bag of food, 
    <br>
        He walks towards a big tree that is tall with long branches to cover him from mother nature. A few days pass anhe runs out of 
    <br>
        food, he walks away from his base and starts walking north. A few hours pass and he found a cave and went into it, once he enters the cave 
    <br>
        encloses on him with rocks closing the entrance, after a few minutes passing through the dark, mysterious cave he hears a hissing noise,
    <br>
        he see a weird symbol on the rocks and continue walking. He stumbles across a cliff leading towards a long drop, he jumps down into the darkness and he sees more and more
    <br>
        different symbols and then the long journey led through to a circular enclosure nest of slimy bugs with what seemed to be a large humanoid figure 
    <br>
        with tentacles at the mouth.
      
    <br>
    <br>  
          The tentacle faced monster notices him and then with a hurenduse, loud scream instructs the slimy aliens to attack him.
