  <p>The lady opens the hatch and it reveals a circular room filled with small squared chambers with<br>
     one door in each, outlining the room. In the middle of this room is a tube with a locked door attached to it,<br>
      above this door it says "Austins Apartments". The lady then says, "My name is Yu, and welcome<br>
       to Austins Apartments. You will follow me into apartment 666". You follow her into the elevator and suddenly Yus' eyes<br>
        suddenly go black and her head lowers a she is still while the elevator goes down.</p>
