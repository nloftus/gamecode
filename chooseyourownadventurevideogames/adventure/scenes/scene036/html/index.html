     <p>You found a device on a desk, a piece of paper "CODE:4505" with a piece of paper right below it that said "PROJECT: ACCELERATION ".<br>
       With pieces of paper showing bluebrints of a veichle with notes saying that can fly beyond the solar system. There was something written with<br>
        black marker on the wall that said "Don't trust ANYONE!".</p>
