<p>You stay silent until you arrive at a huge pyramid glass building the size of two iffel towers with the company name on it named "Fragile Industries" with its<br>
saying under it wich says "The cheapest seller of fragile things in the UNIVERSE!!!" when the helicopter lands on a landing pad on the left side of the building.<br>
The soldiers bring you out of the helicopter and into the building. You see robots made out of glass, guns made out of glass, and many other thing made out of glass.<br>
You and the soldiers approch a elevator and enter it, you observe you're going to the bottom floor. You exit the elevator and enter a humungous room shaped as a<br>
sphere with rows of servers cover the room with one pc and one huge monitor and speakers on the ceiling of the room in the room. On the monitor, is a face, <br>
the face is of a old male which is bald with a long, gray beard. He says "Hello Conda, it's been a while"</p>

  //have it so you enter a room with rows of servers are in the room and one computer with a monitor in the room with the computer telling you to get<br>
5 keys and then he will tell you why you're here and who you are.
