<p>You stay silent until you arrive at a huge pyramid glass building the size of two iffel towers with the company name on it named "Fragile Industries" with its<br>
saying under it wich says "The cheapest seller of fragile things in the UNIVERSE!!!" when the helicopter lands on a landing pad on the left side of the building.<br>
The soldiers bring you out of the helicopter and into the building. You see robots made out of glass, guns made out of glass, and many other thing made out of glass.<br>
You and the soldiers approch a elevator and enter it, you observe you're going to the bottom floor. You exit the elevator</p>
